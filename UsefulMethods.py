    Parameters
    ----------
    file_path: a path to a .csv file of picked peaks
    DESCRIPTION:
    This function will use the file path provided to open the file
    Convert the types to the appropriate type
    From there is will then sort the newly created list from the file
    This list will be sorted by peak height i.e. intensity
