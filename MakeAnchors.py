    '''
    Parameters
    ----------
    list_of_peak_objs : A list containing peaks or peaksets
    sig_val: To establish an acceptable m/z range we want to get the average m/z value from 
    Some very sig peaks, to get these you need to input what intesnity cut off you want to
    use to get the most intese peaks
    DESCRIPTION: filters through the list that is passed and removes
    Values from it that dont satisfy the criteria
    In this case that is those m/z values for peaks that are higher or lower
    Than the average of the very significant peaks with a 10% buffer either way  
    Returns
