        Parameters
        ----------
        rt_list_1 : list of retention times from a picked peak file

        DESCRIPTION: Takes the values from the first list provided and subtracts
        them from the values in the second list provided (they're subtracted at the same index)

        -------
        a list of floats containing the rt differences between the 2 files
