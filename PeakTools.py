        Parameters
        ----------
        peak_obj_list : peak or peakset object
        DESCRIPTION: This will loop over the list attribute in the object,
        extracting the RT values into a sepearate list
        These will be converted to seconds (as mzMINE represent RT in minutes) 
        prior to being placed into the new list.
        Returns
        -------
        List of RT in seconds
        NOTE: if peakset obj list is provided the number of lists returned
        Will be the number of files that make up the peaksets
